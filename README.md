Tarotpedia
----------

This is a small experiment that lets you define a basic tarot spread and draw Wikipedia articles for it.

It is designed to operate as a single page static app that can be deployed to GitHub pages or downloaded and used locally.

Running Locally
---------------

You can have a local copy of this application by downloading the GitHub codebase for it and opening up the index.html page in your browser. Most functionality will work that way!

You won't be able to load links from it, however, if you have Python3 installed on your system, you can use it to run a simple local server:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

And go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
