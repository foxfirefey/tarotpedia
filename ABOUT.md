Taropedia
---------

**Tarotpedia** is a single-page app that combines tarot card spreads with random Wikipedia articles.

### Features

There are three default spreads: one card, three card, and Celtic Cross. If you want to give
your reading a topic, you can use the button next to the spread selection to do so. When you
flip a card or draw it, it presents a link to a random wikipedia article that opens in an
iFrame article viewer below the cards.

Once you have drawn a spread, you can use the share link to share your results with someone, or
download in TSV, CSV, or Markdown.

You can define your own spreads in the settings!

### Settings

Settings are put into local storage in your browser, so they can persist across sessions.

- You can set a specific language for the interface and for the Wikipedia site you are going to,
independently.
- You can toggle on disambiguation pages to be present in your results.
- You can change the position names of the default spreads, as well as create your own spreads.
